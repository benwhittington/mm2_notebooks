## Available Notebook Functions

### ODE

#### Convolution()
Performs the steps of a convolution up to maximum shift specified by the user using a slider.

#### NumericalMethods()
Allows the user to change the various parameters (step size, no. steps) of 3 numerical ODE solvers (Euler, Improved Euler, Runge Kutta)

#### Laplace()
Gives user an interactive example of a function in the t domain being transformed into the s (laplace) domain. Allows user to visualise the effect of changing different parts of the t function.

#### Suspension()
Produces plot of damped suspension system. Gives user sliders to change m, k, c

#### Pendulum()
Animation of a pendulum produced using Runge Kutta to solve system of ODEs. Could alter this to user different solvers?

### Linear Algebra

#### CoordinateTransform()
Takes input from user to transform shapes using transformation matrix. Also option to show eigens.

#### IterativeMethods3D()
Solves and plots solution to 3D system of equations.

#### IterativeMethods2D()
Solves and plots solution to 2D system of equations.


#### EllipseTransform()
Plots ellipses and eigens from equation

#### EigenTransform()
Allows user to select transformation matrix and apply to a shape. Option to show and normalise eigens.

### Fourier Series

#### FourierSeries()
Produces a Fourier Series approximation to a function.

#### RandomWave()
Does a cheat version of a Fourier analysis by producing sinusoids of random amplitude, frequency and shift. And then using these to produce a signal. Intended to give an idea for how any signal can be made from summing sinusoids and what the output of a fourier analysis actually tells you.

#### FourierAnalysis()
Performs the fourier and 3 specific signals and returns variables to be passed into MusicNote

#### MusicNote()
Plots the signal and the Fourier analysis of the signal. Also has slider to constrain frequency axis to allow zooming in on ranges of frequencies.

#### FilterFreqs()
Plots the signal and the Fourier analysis of the signal. Also allows user to filter out a band of frequencies and review what the signal would look like without those frequencies.
